# Traffic-Light
Group Project – Arduino UNO R3  This project implements a fully functional traffic intersection controller using an Arduino UNO R3, two breadboards, LEDs, buttons, and hardware interrupts. It simulates a real-world intersection with North/South and East/West lanes, each with their own traffic lights and pedestrian crosswalks.
